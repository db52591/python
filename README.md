This script crop long screenshot image to A4 size and save into a pdf file, if you have any long screenshot image that you want to convert it into pdf to read it, this is a good way!

run it, then it ask you to choose pdf file or png file (both supported), then ask you to input crop ratio, you can choose "default" or enter your customize ratio, then voila cropped file done.
